# 1. Use FastAPI for ADR-Master Backend

Date: 2024-01-15

## Status

Draft

## Context

We need to build an offline-capable ADR editor with MCP integration and agentic workflow capabilities. The backend needs to be modern, performant, and support async operations for LLM compilation jobs.

## Problem Statement

Choose an appropriate web framework for the ADR-Master backend that supports:
- Async/await for long-running LLM operations
- REST API with OpenAPI documentation
- Python 3.12 compatibility
- Lightweight and fast
- FOSS license

## Decision Drivers

* Performance for async operations
* Built-in API documentation
* Modern Python features support
* Active community and maintenance
* Ease of deployment
* Minimal dependencies

## Considered Options

* FastAPI
* Flask with async support
* Django REST Framework
* Starlette (FastAPI's foundation)

## Decision Outcome

[Decision to be made after analysis]

### Consequences

* Good: [To be filled]
* Bad: [To be filled]
* Neutral: [To be filled]

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### FastAPI

* Good: Native async/await support, automatic OpenAPI docs, type hints, high performance
* Bad: Smaller ecosystem than Flask, newer framework
* Neutral: Opinionated design

### Flask with async

* Good: Large ecosystem, mature, flexible
* Bad: Async support is newer and less mature, manual OpenAPI setup
* Neutral: More boilerplate needed

### Django REST Framework

* Good: Full-featured, batteries included, great admin
* Bad: Heavy for our use case, complex for simple APIs, not async-first
* Neutral: Designed for larger applications

## More Information

FastAPI is built on Starlette and Pydantic, providing excellent performance and developer experience. It's particularly well-suited for our async compilation jobs and MCP integration requirements.
